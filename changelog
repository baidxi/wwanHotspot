      on MAC.

    A great improvement for smooth operation when disabling or enabling Hotspot's
    wireless device.

      therefore continue immediately trying to connect to another Hotspot.

      has been enabled or disabled.
    - When scanning for available hotspots be sure of that iw obtains the list
      without wifi network error.
    - Better management of sleeping intervals.
    - Automatically restart the network when iw scanning returns a network
      error several times.
